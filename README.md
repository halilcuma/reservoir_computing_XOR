## Reservoir Computing XOR Project

Welcome to the Reservoir Computing XOR Project! This project demonstrates the implementation of reservoir computing, a machine-learning algorithm designed to reduce computational resources needed for time-series prediction without compromising accuracy, using Python and PyTorch. This implementation applies reservoir computing to a simple yet classic problem in neural networks: the XOR problem.

### Introduction

Reservoir computing (RC) is a type of recurrent neural network which has shown high performance in time-series forecasting tasks, including chaotic time-series, weather prediction, wind-power generation, and finance. It consists of three main components: an input layer, a reservoir layer, and an output layer.

The main strength of reservoir computing lies in its efficient training process. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks, reservoir computing only trains the output weights, keeping the reservoir weights fixed. This results in a much faster and less computationally intensive training process.

### Project Structure

The core of this project is the Jupyter notebook `Reservoir_XOR.ipynb`, which contains the implementation of the Reservoir Computing algorithm to solve the XOR problem. This notebook includes a brief introduction to Reservoir Computing and the mathematical equations used to describe the reservoir's dynamics. It also demonstrates the PyTorch implementation of the Reservoir Computing algorithm for the XOR problem.
